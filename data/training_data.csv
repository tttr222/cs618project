There is an eccentric 3.8 cm in\X0D\\X0A\diameter areola with a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm everted nipple.  The posterior\X0D\\X0A\surface of the specimen is inked blue.  Sectioning the specimen reveals\X0D\\X0A\two distinct separate biopsy sites and a separate solid nodule.  The\X0D\\X0A\first biopsy site is located within the lower outer quadrant at\X0D\\X0A\approximately the 8:00-9:00 o'clock position and is 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.\X0D\\X0A\This first biopsy site is filled with clotted blood and pebble white\X0D\\X0A\biopsy seed material.  The first biopsy site is 2.0 cm from the nearest\X0D\\X0A\deep margin.  The first biopsy site is also approximately 1 cm deep to\X0D\\X0A\the overlying skin.  The second biopsy site is located within the upper\X0D\\X0A\outer quadrant 2.0 cm superior to the first biopsy site.  The second\X0D\\X0A\biopsy site is approximately 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and is located at the\X0D\\X0A\10:00 o'clock position.  The second biopsy site contains no biopsy seed\X0D\\X0A\material.  The second biopsy site is also 2.0 cm from the nearest deep\X0D\\X0A\margin and 1.0 cm from the overlying skin.  Directly lateral to the\X0D\\X0A\second biopsy site within the upper outer quadrant, there is a 0.6 x 0.5\X0D\\X0A\x 0.5 cm solid white-tan nodule.  The nodule is also located at the\X0D\\X0A\10:00 o'clock position and is 1.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\nodule has a solid white-tan cut surface.

The\X0D\\X0A\procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis)\X0D\\X0A\by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The\X0D\\X0A\Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation\X0D\\X0A\performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are\X0D\\X0A\deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with\X0D\\X0A\appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2\X0D\\X0A\probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The\X0D\\X0A\slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe\X0D\\X0A\reactivity.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Analysis\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification\X0D\\X0A\is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent\X0D\\X0A\foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio\X0D\\X0A\between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\References\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\1) Wolff A.C. et al.

The skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by tumor\X0D\\X0A\emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin\X0D\\X0A\biopsy.  However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an\X0D\\X0A\invasive carcinoma in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal\X0D\\X0A\lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PR, and HER2\X0D\\X0A\status.  Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes\X0D\\X0A\described above do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma.  Locally advanced\X0D\\X0A\breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the\X0D\\X0A\clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify\X0D\\X0A\as inflammatory carcinoma.  Thus the term inflammatory carcinoma should not be\X0D\\X0A\applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in\X0D\\X0A\the course of a patient's disease.  The rare case that exhibits all the features\X0D\\X0A\of inflammatory carcinoma, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third\X0D\\X0A\of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying\X0D\\X0A\carcinoma. \X0D\\X0A\Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) (choose a category based on lymph nodes received with\X0D\\X0A\the specimen; immunohistochemistry and/or molecular studies are not required)\X0D\\X0A\If internal mammary lymph nodes, infraclavicular nodes, or supraclavicular lymph\X0D\\X0A\nodes are included in the specimen, consult the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual1 for\X0D\\X0A\additional lymph node categories.\X0D\\X0A\Modifier (required only if applicable)\X0D\\X0A\     ___ (sn):     Only sentinel node(s) evaluated.

Nodes containing\X0D\\X0A\only ITCs are excluded from the total positive node count for purposes of N\X0D\\X0A\classification but should be included in the total number of nodes evaluated.\X0D\\X0A\     ___ pN0 (i-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically,\X0D\\X0A\negative IHC\X0D\\X0A\___ pN0 (i+):     Malignant cells in regional lymph node(s) no greater than 0.2\X0D\\X0A\mm and no more than 200 cells (detected by H\E\T\E\E or IHC including ITC)\X0D\\X0A\___ pN0 (mol-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative\X0D\\X0A\molecular findings (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR])\X0D\\X0A\___ pN0 (mol+):     Positive molecular findings (RT-PCR), but no regional lymph\X0D\\X0A\node metastases detected by histology or IHC\X0D\\X0A\___ pN1mi:     Micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells,\X0D\\X0A\but none greater than 2.0 mm).\X0D\\X0A\___ pN1a:     Metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, at least 1 metastasis\X0D\\X0A\greater than 2.0 mm\X0D\\X0A\___ pN2a:     Metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor\X0D\\X0A\deposit greater than 2.0 mm)\X0D\\X0A\___ pN3a:     Metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor\X0D\\X0A\deposit greater than 2.0 mm)\X0D\\X0A\# Approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3-dimensional 0.2-mm\X0D\\X0A\cluster.  Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single\X0D\\X0A\dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in\X0D\\X0A\a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that\X0D\\X0A\more than 1000 cells are present in the node.  In these situations, the node\X0D\\X0A\should be classified as containing a micrometastasis (pN1mi).  Cells in\X0D\\X0A\different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the\X0D\\X0A\block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile\X0D\\X0A\even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices.  It is\X0D\\X0A\recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC\X0D\\X0A\and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories because of inherent\X0D\\X0A\limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden\X0D\\X0A\in lymph nodes.  Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a\X0D\\X0A\guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories.  The\X0D\\X0A\pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster\X0D\\X0A\of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of\X0D\\X0A\isolated tumor

The\X0D\\X0A\procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis)\X0D\\X0A\by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The\X0D\\X0A\Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation\X0D\\X0A\performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are\X0D\\X0A\deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with\X0D\\X0A\appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2\X0D\\X0A\probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The\X0D\\X0A\slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe\X0D\\X0A\reactivity.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Analysis\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification\X0D\\X0A\is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent\X0D\\X0A\foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio\X0D\\X0A\between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\References\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\1) Wolff A.C. et al.

The specimen is\X0D\\X0A\partially surfaced by a 5.5x3.8 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple\X0D\\X0A\measures 1.4 cm in diameter. The deep margin is inked black and sectioning\X0D\\X0A\reveals approximately equal proportions of yellow adipose tissue and dense white\X0D\\X0A\fibrocystic breast tissue. No masses, suspicious lesions or previous biopsy\X0D\\X0A\sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of\X0D\\X0A\sections: 1A-1I  representative sections of fibrocystic breast tissue; 1J \X0D\\X0A\representative section of nipple. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 2 labeled #1 sentinel node and #2 sentinel node, received fresh for\X0D\\X0A\frozen section, consists of two tan/pink lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.5 cm in\X0D\\X0A\greatest dimension which are submitted entirely for frozen section, now\X0D\\X0A\resubmitted in cassette 2. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 3 labeled right breast tissue, received in formalin, consists of a\X0D\\X0A\422.2 gram intact simple mastectomy specimen with overall dimensions of\X0D\\X0A\18.0x15.0x4.0 cm. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 6.0x3.5 cm tan\X0D\\X0A\wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1.4 cm in diameter. There is\X0D\\X0A\a suture designating the superior aspect. The margins are inked as follows:\X0D\\X0A\superficial margin blue, deep margin black, and sectioning reveals a 0.8x0.8x0.7\X0D\\X0A\cm tan/pink biopsy cavity, 1.5 cm from the deep margin and 1.7 cm from the\X0D\\X0A\superficial margin. Located 3.3 cm lateral from this site is a 1.1x0.8x0.8 cm\X0D\\X0A\tan biopsy site containing a metal clip. The more lateral biopsy site is 0.8 cm\X0D\\X0A\from the deep margin and 1.9 cm from the superficial margin. The tissue between\X0D\\X0A\the two biopsy sites is tan/pink and fibrocystic. The two biopsy sites are\X0D\\X0A\located in the upper central to outer quadrant. Sectioning through the remaining\X0D\\X0A\breast tissue reveals dense white fibrocystic breast tissue. No other definitive\X0D\\X0A\masses or biopsy sites are identified.

The ducts show no\X0D\\X0A\epithelial proliferation and occasional ducts show apocrine metaplastic change.\X0D\\X0A\One of the ducts shows a small sclerotic intraductal papilloma. Sections of the\X0D\\X0A\skin of nipple are remarkable for benign squamous epithelium without atypia and\X0D\\X0A\no evidence of lymphvascular infiltration in the dermal lymphatics. There is a\X0D\\X0A\small fibroadenoma less than 1 mm in size in block 1I. \X0D\\X0A\Sections of the two lymph nodes show mildly reactive nodes with a modest degree\X0D\\X0A\of sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of granulomatous inflammation or\X0D\\X0A\metastatic tumor.\X0D\\X0A\Sections of the right breast show a single small focus of residual\X0D\\X0A\intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ.

There is a central 2.5 cm in\X0D\\X0A\diameter areola with a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm slightly retracted black\X0D\\X0A\inverted nipple.

There is no orientation provided, thus the aspect of the\X0D\\X0A\specimen with the larger flap of fibro-fatty tissue will be designated\X0D\\X0A\superior.  The posterior surface of the specimen is inked blue.\X0D\\X0A\Sectioning the specimen reveals a 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm biopsy cavity within\X0D\\X0A\the upper inner quadrant at the 11:00 o'clock position.  The biopsy\X0D\\X0A\cavity is packed with white pebble-like biopsy seed material.  The\X0D\\X0A\biopsy cavity is 0.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The biopsy cavity\X0D\\X0A\is surrounded by punctate foci of hemorrhage and fat necrosis, as well\X0D\\X0A\as a very ill-defined area of indurated dense white-tan fibrous breast\X0D\\X0A\tissue.  The indurated fibrous tissue surrounding the biopsy site\X0D\\X0A\measures approximately 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  There is also a small amount\X0D\\X0A\of indurated slightly granular fibrous tissue noted extending superiorly\X0D\\X0A\from the biopsy site.  There are no distinct well-circumscribed masses\X0D\\X0A\seen.  There are no other lesional areas identified.  The remainder of\X0D\\X0A\the specimen is notable for a moderate amount of dense white-tan fibrous\X0D\\X0A\breast tissue and multiple blue-domed cystic structures.

JAB:jlj","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\A)  The lymph node shows a normal architecture and an intact capsule.\X0D\\X0A\There are mild reactive changes but no evidence of primary or metastatic\X0D\\X0A\neoplasm.\X0D\\X0A\B)  Numerous sections from around the circumference of the biopsy site\X0D\\X0A\reveal very complicated radial scars with complex papillomatosis.  In\X0D\\X0A\the center of this area, there is both an intraductal and infiltrating\X0D\\X0A\duct carcinoma present.  The intraductal component which makes up\X0D\\X0A\approximately 50% of the tumor shows very large duct structures\X0D\\X0A\distended by atypical epithelial cells in very complicated\X0D\\X0A\cribriform-type patterns with central areas of eosinophilic\X0D\\X0A\comedonecrosis.  The invasive portion of the tumor shows small fairly\X0D\\X0A\solid aggregates of epithelial cells with focal lumen formations but\X0D\\X0A\without well-formed tubular structures present.  These cells show small\X0D\\X0A\to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and contain nuclei which vary markedly\X0D\\X0A\from small and pyknotic up to giant vesicular nuclei with variably\X0D\\X0A\prominent nucleoli.  Occasional mitoses can be identified averaging 2\X0D\\X0A\per 10 high-power fields.  These microscopic findings would score a 3\X0D\\X0A\for tubule formation, 3 for nuclear pleomorphism, and 1 for mitotic\X0D\\X0A\count for a combined EBR score of 7, which is moderately differentiated.\X0D\\X0A\No definite lymphvascular invasion can be identified.  The neoplasm\X0D\\X0A\shows numerous microcalcifications.  An immunoperoxidase stain for\X0D\\X0A\e-cadherin reveals marked cytoplasmic positivity of the invasive\X0D\\X0A\neoplastic cells indicative of ductal origin.

The specimen is received in a Transpec container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and ""left breast.""  The specimen is accompanied by a mammographic film and is found to contain a localization needle.  The film demonstrates a dense mass, fairly well-delineated lying adjacent to the midportion of the localization needle. The surgical margins are inked beginning with the superior lateral and proceeding in a clockwise fashion with red, green, orange and black.  The deep margin is inked with purple.  The breast tissue is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Grossly the mass lies approximately 1 cm. or more from all margins except for the superior deep where it lies approximately 5 mm. or less from the inked surface.  The mass and this nearest margin are represented in Blocks A1 and 2.  The breast tissue shows evidence of blue dye discoloration consistent with tracer dye injection.  The nearest margins from the anterior inferior lateral quadrant are placed in Block A3, the anterior superior lateral quadrant margin in Block A4, the anterior inferior medial quadrant in Block A5 and the anterior superior medial quadrant in Block A6. B.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and ""left axillary sentinel lymph node.""  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a portion of lobulated yellow-red tissue, measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm.  The specimen is bisected revealing an encapsulated structure grossly consistent with lymph node.  The outer edge has a peripheral rim of tan-pink tissue while most of the tissue consists of adipose tissue consistent with fatty infiltrate.  No gross evidence of metastatic disease is identified.  The specimen is totally submitted in Block B. C.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and ""additional superior and deep margin left breast.""  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a lobulated portion of yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm.  A surgical suture indicates the new margin.  The new margin is inked and the tissues are serially sectioned and are uniform lobulated yellow glistening throughout.  Multiple full thickness sections are placed in Blocks C1-4.

Microscopically this mass is composed of atypical epithelial cells forming an infiltrating pattern of tubules surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction.  The cells are mildly pleomorphic and the mitotic rate is low.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Grossly and microscopically, the neoplasm is noted to extend to within approximately 5 mm. of the superior deep margin.  The remaining margins are widely free of tumor by 1 cm. or more.   The additional superior deep margin submitted as Specimen C shows no evidence of carcinoma, therefore, all final margins are felt to be widely free of tumor. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the left axillary sentinel lymph node (Specimen B).  Staging criteria: T1c, N0 probable Stage IA.  Histopathologic grade: tubule formation 1, nuclear pleomorphism 2 and mitotic count 1 for a total score of 4 points, designated as a Grade I, G1 low histologic grade neoplasm.

No lymph nodes are present.\X0D\\X0A\Representative sections are placed in formalin at 11:35 a.m. Summary of\X0D\\X0A\sections: 3A-3B  deep margin closest to clip; 3C-3D  representative sections of\X0D\\X0A\breast tissue containing clip; 3E-3H  representative sections of breast tissue\X0D\\X0A\between the clip and invasive mass; 3I-3K  representative sections of invasive\X0D\\X0A\mass to include blue-inked superficial margin; 3L  representative section of\X0D\\X0A\deep margin closest to invasive mass; 3M  representative section of nipple. \X0D\\X0A\**INITIALS","Microscopic Description\X0D\\X0A\Sections of the left breast show extensive lobular carcinoma in situ\X0D\\X0A\characterized by lobular and ductal elements that have been overfilled by\X0D\\X0A\proliferation of neoplastic lobular elements. Lobules are frequently filled and\X0D\\X0A\the neoplasm extends up the adjacent ducts. Scattered microcalcifications are\X0D\\X0A\seen. The invasive lobular carcinoma is noted focally and measures 7 mm x 4 mm x\X0D\\X0A\4 mm. The in situ component comprises approximately 90% of the neoplasm present\X0D\\X0A\and its size is difficult to estimate because of its presence in multiple tissue\X0D\\X0A\blocks and is estimated at between 15mm x 5mm x 5 mm.  There are extensive\X0D\\X0A\calcifications within the breast and these appear to be associated predominantly\X0D\\X0A\with two small tubular adenomatous proliferation one of which measures\X0D\\X0A\approximately 5mm x 5mm x 5 mm. Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within\X0D\\X0A\the breast tissue. Sections of the breast skin and nipple show no definite\X0D\\X0A\pagetoid intraepithelial spread and no involvement of the dermal lymphatics. \X0D\\X0A\Sections of the right sentinel lymph node which has been bisected shows mild\X0D\\X0A\sinus histiocytosis. There is no tumor noted in the subcapsular spaces. The node\X0D\\X0A\is immunostained with estrogen and pankeratin which confirms no tumor identified\X0D\\X0A\in the lymph node. \X0D\\X0A\Sections of the right simple mastectomy show a lobular carcinoma that is\X0D\\X0A\infiltrative and extensively present in situ. The infiltrating component of the\X0D\\X0A\tumor measures 22mm x 12mm x approximately 12 mm. There is no lymphvascular\X0D\\X0A\invasion identified. Lobular carcinoma in situ is extensively seen and\X0D\\X0A\approximates at least 60% of the tumor. The margins of excision are free of\X0D\\X0A\tumor; however, the deep margin is close and less than 1 mm (see block 3J).\X0D\\X0A\Calcifications are also abundantly noted throughout the sampled breast sections.\X0D\\X0A\Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within the breast tissue.

The specimen is 19.6 cm from medial to lateral, 17.1 cm from\X0D\\X0A\superior to inferior, and 3.8 cm from anterior to posterior.  Covering the\X0D\\X0A\central portion of the superficial surface of the breast, there is an 18.0 x\X0D\\X0A\12.5 cm ellipse of white tan skin which includes a 3.2-cm in diameter areola and\X0D\\X0A\a 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm nipple.  The tissue encircling the nipple and areola are\X0D\\X0A\discolored by a blue dye.  The skin is otherwise unremarkable.  The superior and\X0D\\X0A\inferior soft tissue margins are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep\X0D\\X0A\margin is covered by fascia and shows a few thin and delicate strands of\X0D\\X0A\adherent skeletal muscle.  The superior soft tissue margin is inked blue, the\X0D\\X0A\inferior soft tissue margin is inked yellow, and the deep soft tissue margin is\X0D\\X0A\inked black.  The specimen is then serially sectioned.  This reveals a 1.7 x 1.3\X0D\\X0A\x 1.0 cm nodule of firm tan tissue within the lower outer quadrant of the\X0D\\X0A\breast.  This is 0.8 cm from the deep margin which is the closest margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\site of previous biopsy is not apparent.   The breast away from this lesion is\X0D\\X0A\composed primarily of fat with bands and islands of white mammary tissue\X0D\\X0A\scattered within.  No other focal lesions are seen.

The specimen is 21.2 cm from medial to lateral, 20.5 cm from\X0D\\X0A\superior to inferior, and 5.9 cm from superficial to deep.  The mid superficial\X0D\\X0A\surface is partially covered by 16.5 x 11.7 cm elliptical piece of white tan\X0D\\X0A\skin which includes a 3.7 cm in diameter areola with a central 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.6\X0D\\X0A\cm nipple.

The specimen is 15.0 cm from superior to inferior,\X0D\\X0A\15.1 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.4 cm from superficial to deep.  The\X0D\\X0A\superficial surface is partially covered by a 13.1 x 5.3 x 0.3 cm ellipse of\X0D\\X0A\white tan skin, which includes a 2.6-cm in diameter pale areola with a central\X0D\\X0A\1.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm pale nipple.  Near the superior medial skin margin, there is\X0D\\X0A\a parallel 4.5 cm scar.  The scar varies from 0.1 to 0.3 cm from the superior\X0D\\X0A\skin margin.  The skin is also remarkable for a 1.7 x 0.5 cm scar over the upper\X0D\\X0A\outer quadrant.  The superior and inferior soft tissue margins are composed of\X0D\\X0A\lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is partially covered by fascia and has\X0D\\X0A\a central adherent 5.7 x 5.3 x 0.7 cm aggregate of skeletal muscle.  A metal\X0D\\X0A\clip is also present near the deep lateral margin.  The superior soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\margin is inked blue, the inferior soft tissue margin is inked yellow and the\X0D\\X0A\deep soft tissue margin is inked black.  The specimen is then serially sectioned\X0D\\X0A\from medial to lateral.  This reveals a poorly defined 5 x 4 x 3 cm area of firm\X0D\\X0A\white fibrous-like tissue within the mid and mid lateral aspect of the specimen.\X0D\\X0A\ This area is suspicious for tumor. Within this poorly defined area of\X0D\\X0A\induration, a small metal marker is identified within the upper outer quadrant. \X0D\\X0A\This is the only evidence seen of previous biopsy.

The large bowel consists of\X0D\\X0A\cecum, ascending, transverse, descending, and probable portion of sigmoid colon.  It\X0D\\X0A\measures approximately 100.0 cm. in length.  Approximately two-thirds of the colonic portion\X0D\\X0A\of the specimen is dilated with dilation up to 12.0 cm. in the cecum.  Immediately distal to\X0D\\X0A\the area of dilatation, there is a mass, oriented by the surgeon as at the splenic flexure,\X0D\\X0A\with puckering of the overlying serosa, adherent adipose tissue, and with a small amount of\X0D\\X0A\adherent pancreatic tissue.  Beyond this, the colon has an approximate normal diameter of\X0D\\X0A\2.0 cm. for a distance measuring approximately 30 cm.  The bowel segment is opened and is\X0D\\X0A\shown to contain abundant yellow-green liquid stool proximal to the mass and a small amount\X0D\\X0A\of formed dark green stool distal to the mass.  The mass itself consists of an intraluminal\X0D\\X0A\tumor which is nearly circumferential measuring 4.0 x 3.0 cm. on its surface.  It has\X0D\\X0A\central ulceration and rolled borders and is located approximately 30 cm. from the distal\X0D\\X0A\margin and approximately 100 cm. from the proximal margin.  The attached portion of pancreas\X0D\\X0A\and adjacent soft tissue contains a staple line at its margin.  The staple line is removed\X0D\\X0A\showing no obvious tumor.  This margin is located 6.0 cm. from the intraluminal tumor.

The serosal tissues and adherent adipose tissues in the area\X0D\\X0A\of the tumor are puckered.  These margins are inked with black ink.  Sections of the tumor\X0D\\X0A\show extension through the wall of the bowel into the adjacent mesenteric adipose tissue and\X0D\\X0A\pancreas.  The tumor extends to within 0.1 cm. of the inked soft tissue margins in these\X0D\\X0A\areas.  The tumor is approximately flask-shaped measuring up to 5 cm. in thickness.\X0D\\X0A\ \X0D\\X0A\There is a large polyp in the ascending colon measuring up to 1.0 cm. in diameter.  Two (2)\X0D\\X0A\smaller similar-appearing polyps are noted in the descending colon measuring 0.5 cm. and 0.3\X0D\\X0A\cm. in diameter.  The remainder of the mucosa is folded and light tan.  In the cecum, there\X0D\\X0A\is a defect which has been closed with sutures measuring up to 1.5 cm. in length.  It is\X0D\\X0A\surrounded by hemorrhage on the serosal surface and is suggestive of perforation.  Scattered\X0D\\X0A\diverticula are noted.\X0D\\X0A\ \X0D\\X0A\There is an appendix at the cecum measuring 5.5 cm. in length by 0.6 cm. diameter.

The specimen is received in formalin.  The first, and largest, is reddish-pink, lobulated, measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm.  The base is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned.  The tissue is friable, glistening tan-pink throughout.  This portion of the specimen is totally submitted in Block 1.  The second portion is tan-pink, lobulated, measuring 1 cm. in greatest dimensions.  The base is inked, the specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted in Block 2.","COMMENT WORD: The microscopic sections of the larger polyp submitted in Block 1 shows evidence of an adenomatous villous lesion.  There is easily identified adenocarcinoma in-situ as well as superficially invasive carcinoma. Within focal areas the neoplasm extends through the muscularis mucosa into submucosa.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  It is noted that there is a peripheral rim of cauterized normal colonic mucosa, possibly indicating the lesion is totally excised.  The following staging criteria will be modified if additional specimens are received: T1 possible Stage I.  Histopathologic grade: G2, moderately differentiated.  Residual tumor, favoring R0, margins histologically negative. Histopathologic type: adenocarcinoma. The microscopic sections of the smaller polyp submitted in Block 2 shows evidence of a villoglandular adenomatous polyp.  There is moderate nuclear atypia with nuclei beginning to show evidence of prominent nucleoli.  There is nuclear crowding due to hypercellularity and pseudostratification of nuclei.  These findings are felt to indicate the presence of a high-grade lesion.  This polyp also shows evidence of a peripheral rim of cauterized normal colonic mucosa and, therefore, may be totally excised.   These findings should be correlated with clinical history and symptomatology.","Submitting Physician: **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Status: SOUT.

Specimen #1 - is received fresh for frozen section/touch prep labeled mesenteric mass, and consists of a segment of small intestine measuring 33 cm. in length x 4.5 cm. in diameter. On opening the mucosa shows a small tan nodule that measures approximately 4 mm in diameter. The mucosa shows no additional lesions grossly present. Within the mesenteric fat are two distinct separate masses as follows: the largest is a well-circumscribed tan oval mass that measures 9.5 x 9.0 x 7.5 cm.  On sectioning it has a homogeneous maroon cut surface with few cystic degenerated areas. The other mass is tan-yellow firm and measures 3.0 cm. in diameter.  It is located within the mesenteric fat and extends within the small bowel wall without erosion or ulceration of the overlying mucosa. In addition, there are few small lymph nodes within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted in 14 cassettes labeled ""1A"" through ""1N"" as follows:  ""1A"" - proximal and distal resection margins, ""1B"" - small mucosal nodule, ""1C"" and ""1D"" sections from small mesenteric mass- ""1E"" through ""1L"" - multiple sections from the large mesenteric mass, and ""1M"" and ""1N"" multiple small lymph nodes in each cassette. TOUCH PREP EVALUATION:  MONOTONOUS ROUND TUMOR CELLS, FAVOR NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR. A PORTION OF THE SPECIMEN IS SUBMITTED IN RPMI SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE FLOW CYTOMETRY STUDIES. Specimen #2 - is received in formalin labeled segment of ileum distal to mass (suture is distal) and consists of a segment of ileum that measures 11 cm. in length x 4 cm. in diameter.  There is mesenteric fat attached that measures up to 3.0 cm. in length.  On opening there is a tan-yellow mucosal nodule that measures approximately 5 mm. in diameter. No additional nodules or suspicious lesions are grossly present.  Sectioning of the mesenteric fat reveals no lymph nodes.  Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes labeled ""2A"" through ""2C"" as follows:  ""2A"" - distal margin, ""2B"" - proximal margin, and ""2C"" - mucosal nodule and unremarkable adjacent small intestine mucosa. Specimen #3 - is received in formalin labeled right colon, suture at base of mesenteric mass, and consists of a right hemicolectomy specimen as follows:  There is a segment of terminal ileum that measures 8 cm. in length x 6 cm. in diameter and a segment of right colon that measures 34 cm. in length x 10 cm. in circumference.  Opening of the small intestine reveals numerous tan-white nodular projections - measuring up to 0.4 cm. in maximum diameter.  Opening of the right colon reveals a tan polypoid mass that measures 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm.  There is also another smaller polyp that measures 4 mm. in diameter.  No additional lesions are identified. Also, the appendix is identified and measures 6.5 cm. in length x 0.6 cm. in diameter.  On sectioning, it is unremarkable.  The pericolic fat measures up to 8.0 cm. in maximum thickness.  On sectioning, it reveals numerous lymph nodes - measuring up to 1.0 cm. in greatest diameter.  Also, a suture is present, designating the base of the mesenteric mass. The area with the suture shows no suspicious-firm nodules present.  Representative sections are submitted in 20 cassettes - labeled ""3A"" through ""3T"", as follows:  ""3A"" - proximal margin, ""3B"" - distal margin, ""3C"" through ""3F"" - nodular white projections of small intestine mucosa, ""3G"" - small polyp of right colon and representative sections from appendix, ""3H"" through ""3O"" - large polyp of right colon, entirely submitted, ""3P"" - one lymph node  bisected, ""3Q"" through ""3T"" - multiple lymph nodes in each cassette. Specimen #4 - is received in formalin labeled distal ileum with anastomosis and consists of a segment of small intestine, measuring 87 cm. in length x 6 cm. in circumference.  On opening, there is an area that measures 15 cm. in length with numerous white mucosal nodular projections. This area shows anastomosis with a segment of unremarkable small intestine that measures 7 cm. in length x 6 cm. in circumference. A distinct segment with brown hemorrhagic dusky discoloration, suspicious for ischemia is present, measuring approximately 20.0 cm in length and is located 7 cm. from the new resection margin. The mesenteric fat measures 8 cm. in length and, on sectioning, reveals two tan nodules that measure 0.8 and 1.2 cm. in diameter.  Also, received within the container is a segment of omentum that measures 10 x 6 x 1 cm.  On sectioning, no nodules are identified.  Representative sections are submitted in 11 cassettes labeled ""A"" through ""K"" as follows:  ""4A"" - new resection margin, ""4B"" - opposite margin, ""4C"" through ""4G"" - representative sections from area with mucosal nodules, ""4H"" and ""4I"" - congested (? ischemic) mucosa, ""4J"" - firm nodules within mesenteric fat, and ""4K"" - representative sections from omentum. Specimen #5 - is received in formalin labeled anastomosis and consists of two irregularly linear shaped pieces of tan tissue that measure 2.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm. and 1.8 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Metallic clips are noted. Per surgeon, no microscopic diagnosis is necessary as they represent excess tissue from the anastomosis.

Located 4.5 cm from one\X0D\\X0A\sutured margin, there is a puckered and firm area seen on the serosa.  This area\X0D\\X0A\is marked with ink for later identification.  When opened, the specimen is found\X0D\\X0A\to contain a metallic mesh stent which begins at the sutured margin near the\X0D\\X0A\area of serosal dimpling and extends 10 cm up the lumen from that margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\lumen remains patent although the area closest to the margin (in the area of the\X0D\\X0A\serosal dimpling) is narrowed to 1.5 cm in diameter.  This is in comparison to\X0D\\X0A\an average diameter of 3 cm.  The area of the metallic stent is covered by\X0D\\X0A\mucoid material.  Beginning 1.5 cm from the sutured margin associated with the\X0D\\X0A\stent, there is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm circumferential area of ulcerated firm tan\X0D\\X0A\tissue.

The specimen consists of a 36.6 cm. in length portion of left colon measuring 4.4 x 4.3 cm. in diameter. Surface hyperemia is identified.  The specimen is inspected to reveal two areas of surface tattoo.  The specimen is then opened to reveal an edematous colon showing rare outpouchings in the anti-mesenteric wall, likely signifying diverticuli.  Approximately 4.2 cm. from one staple end and adjacent to the first black surface dye is a sessile bosselated gray-tan mass measuring 1.7 x 1.3 cm. Approximately 3.1 cm. from this polyp is an area of erosion with a sessile appearing polyp and this correlates with the second surface black dye.  The specimen is then serially sectioned perpendicularly to the longest axis and examined to reveal the first sessile polypoid mass to focally appear to penetrate the lamina propria but doesn't appear to penetrate the muscularis propria.  The second polyp also appears to not invade the muscularis propria grossly.  The remaining mucosa is edematous and appears hyperemic in areas.  No additional mass lesions or polyps are identified. The pericolonic adipose tissue is sectioned and palpated for lymph nodes.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.9 x 0.8 cm. to as small as 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: proximal-distal - ""A"" and ""B"", first polypoid mass entirely submitted in ""C"" through ""G"", a second polypoid lesion - ""H"" and ""I"", single lymph nodes each submitted in ""J"" through ""X"".",,"Specimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1].

Operative\X0D\\X0A\procedure: exploratory laparotomy.\X0D\\X0A\","GROSS DESCRIPTION\X0D\\X0A\The specimen is submitted in formalin labeled right colon and consists of a\X0D\\X0A\previously partially opened segment of large bowel with portion of terminal\X0D\\X0A\ileum. The right colon measures 26 cm in length x approximately 3.5 cm in\X0D\\X0A\average diameter with the cecum measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter. The\X0D\\X0A\terminal ileum measures 7.5 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter. At the\X0D\\X0A\approximate mid portion of the right colon is a fungating ulcerating tumorous\X0D\\X0A\mass measuring 3.2 x 4.1 cm.  It is approximately 12.5 cm from the colonic\X0D\\X0A\margin and 10.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. The closest radial mesenteric\X0D\\X0A\margin to tumor measures 6.2 cm. On sectioning the tumor it is pasty yellow\X0D\\X0A\and necrotic extending from the submuscular fat. Maximal tumor thickness is\X0D\\X0A\1.2 cm. The distal colonic mucosa demonstrates unremarkable rugosal folds\X0D\\X0A\while the more proximal segment including cecum is leathery and indurated\X0D\\X0A\with loss of mucosal folds. At this portion the maximal circumference of the\X0D\\X0A\bowel is 14.5 cm. The appendix is purplish red measuring 5 x 0.6 cm. On\X0D\\X0A\sectioning, the appendiceal wall is indurated as well. The external surface\X0D\\X0A\of the bowel is notable for areas of adhesion formation around the terminal\X0D\\X0A\ileum and cecum with areas of hemorrhagic discoloration, however, no\X0D\\X0A\definitive evidence of peritonitis or perforation is identified (history of\X0D\\X0A\free air and a tiny perforation at the time of surgery is noted. The terminal\X0D\\X0A\ileum is patent with soft yellow stool. No additional mucosal lesions are\X0D\\X0A\identified. Upon separating the mesenteric and omental fat from the main\X0D\\X0A\specimen, a few narrow necked diverticula are identified.  The adipose tissue\X0D\\X0A\is serially sectioned and a few pinkish lymph nodes are found ranging from\X0D\\X0A\0.1 to 0.7 cm. The fat is post fixed in alcohol with additional node search\X0D\\X0A\to follow.  Summary of sections: colonic margin A1, ileal margin A2, sections\X0D\\X0A\of tumor A3-A6, indurated cecum and proximal ascending colon A7, appendix A8,\X0D\\X0A\adhesions in ileum and diverticulum A9, lymph nodes A10.

See note.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE:  As this tumor demonstrates microsatellite stability then further testing for KRAS and\X0D\\X0A\BRAF would be indicated.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\COMMENT: Microsatellite instability (MSI) due to defective mismatch repair genes has been\X0D\\X0A\reported in a subset of sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas, as well as in adenocarcinomas\X0D\\X0A\arising in patients with Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or\X0D\\X0A\HNPCC). As a consequence of this alteration, these adenocarcinomas are all associated with\X0D\\X0A\high-level `microsatellite instability' (MSI), the most common mechanism of which is loss of\X0D\\X0A\function of one or more of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins known as MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, and\X0D\\X0A\PMS2. Molecular testing for MSI or immunohistochemical studies looking for loss of\X0D\\X0A\expression of the MMR proteins are thus effective methods of screening for this unique\X0D\\X0A\subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas. IHC, particularly with the use of antibodies to all\X0D\\X0A\four major MMR proteins, can identify MSI adenocarcinomas with extremely high sensitivity\X0D\\X0A\and specificity. Furthermore, IHC analysis of the four MMR proteins can provide a highly\X0D\\X0A\sensitive strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation-carrying, early-onset\X0D\\X0A\colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, many of whom might be missed by using clinical criteria\X0D\\X0A\(e.g., the **PLACE Criteria) alone. IHC analysis has several advantages over MSI testing,\X0D\\X0A\as the latter is more difficult to perform, and does not provide gene-specific information.\X0D\\X0A\Identification of this important subset of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data\X0D\\X0A\suggest that sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with MSI have a significantly better\X0D\\X0A\prognosis compared with those with intact MMR. In addition, several studies have suggested\X0D\\X0A\that MSI adenocarcinomas may be resistant to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Antibody/Clone            Marker For               Results\X0D\\X0A\MLH-1/G168-728        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed\X0D\\X0A\MSH-2/G219-1129        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00224\X0D\\X0A\MSH-6/44                     MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00225\X0D\\X0A\PMS2/MRQ-28            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Detection System - Polymer\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE: Genetic counseling may be appropriate to explain the implication of this test results.\X0D\\X0A\A positive result, indicating loss of one or more MMR proteins, should be confirmed by\X0D\\X0A\sequencing that particular protein. MLH1 promoter methylation should be ruled out by\X0D\\X0A\appropriate testing, in cases which show loss of only MLH1 protein.

The cut surfaces of the nodules are\X0D\\X0A\anthracotic.  The tissue is entirely submitted in two cassettes.\X0D\\X0A\D)  Part D is labeled \""right upper lobe\"".  The specimen is received in\X0D\\X0A\fixative and consists of a 223 gram, 15 x 10.5 x 4 cm lobe of lung.  The\X0D\\X0A\pleura is gray and smooth without adhesions.  An 11 cm staple line is\X0D\\X0A\located along the edge of the lung.  The cut surface has focal areas\X0D\\X0A\containing dilated air filled spaces.  The remaining cut surface is deep\X0D\\X0A\red and spongy.  Multiple anthracotic lymph nodes are located\X0D\\X0A\surrounding the bronchi.

The tissue is\X0D\\X0A\entirely submitted in two cassettes.\X0D\\X0A\JMM:jlj","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\A)  The frozen section block of the tumor and permanent sections of the\X0D\\X0A\wedge excision demonstrates the presence of an infiltrating tumor with a\X0D\\X0A\semicircumscribed but pushing margin with focal finger-like extensions.\X0D\\X0A\The tumor shows areas of necrosis within a relatively solid cohesive\X0D\\X0A\infiltrative mass.  Individual cells are noted with relatively abundant\X0D\\X0A\eosinophilic cytoplasm and variable sized enlarged nuclei possessing one\X0D\\X0A\or more nucleoli and frequent mitoses.  The nuclei are somewhat\X0D\\X0A\eccentric within the cytoplasm in many of the cells.  There is some\X0D\\X0A\suggestion of intercellular bridging.  The tumor appears entirely\X0D\\X0A\confined within the lung tissue resection margins.  Adjacent to the\X0D\\X0A\tumor, the lung appears more atelectatic focally.  One section shows\X0D\\X0A\tumor cells spilling out within adjacent alveolar airspaces.  The\X0D\\X0A\closest approach to an inked margin is 2 mm.  There is no evidence of\X0D\\X0A\vascular invasion.  Some emphysematous changes are observed within the\X0D\\X0A\adjacent lung.\X0D\\X0A\B)  The B specimen includes a main pulmonary artery lymph node in\X0D\\X0A\multiple cross-sections.  This shows prominent aggregates of sinus\X0D\\X0A\histiocytes within the parenchyma.  The latter are somewhat soot\X0D\\X0A\pigmented.  There is no evidence of metastatic tumor within the lymph\X0D\\X0A\node section.\X0D\\X0A\C)  The C specimen, from the right superior mediastinum, includes\X0D\\X0A\multiple cross-sections of an additional lymph node showing similar\X0D\\X0A\sinus histiocytosis and soot dust accumulation within histiocytes.\X0D\\X0A\There are a few hyalinized small blood vessels within the medullary\X0D\\X0A\center.  No evidence of metastatic carcinoma is observed within this\X0D\\X0A\lymph node as well.\X0D\\X0A\D)  The en face bronchial margin of the resected right upper lobe,\X0D\\X0A\submitted as D, demonstrates benign bronchial cartilage and columnar\X0D\\X0A\pseudostratified mucosa without atypia and with some seromucinous glands\X0D\\X0A\within the surrounding connective tissue.  The proximal vascular margins\X0D\\X0A\are free of tumor and show only some mild atherosclerotic changes within\X0D\\X0A\the pulmonary arterial vasculature.  The more dilated airspaces show\X0D\\X0A\some mild bronchiolar metaplasia and are otherwise without remarkable\X0D\\X0A\features.  There is fusion of adjacent alveolar air sacs to form large\X0D\\X0A\cystic spaces.  The remaining lung shows lesser emphysematous changes\X0D\\X0A\but with a somewhat generalized saccular dilatation of several adjacent\X0D\\X0A\fused alveoli.\X0D\\X0A\Six lymph nodes in block D5, one trisected lymph node in D6 and a\X0D\\X0A\fragmented lymph node in D7 demonstrate similar sinus histiocytosis\X0D\\X0A\changes.  There is no evidence of tumor metastasis in any of the lymph\X0D\\X0A\nodes.\X0D\\X0A\E)  The E portion includes a lymph node with similar sinus histiocytosis\X0D\\X0A\changes and a large area of calcification apparently representing an old\X0D\\X0A\calcified granuloma.  This has a thin fibrotic wall.  There is no tumor\X0D\\X0A\involvement.\X0D\\X0A\F)  The final lymph node, F, shows similar sinus histiocytosis and soot\X0D\\X0A\dust anthracosis changes.

The cells are large with abundant cytoplasm and centrally located ovoid nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli.  No attempts at keratinization are identified.  Tumor infiltrates within fibrous tissue and adjacent skeletal muscle fragments.  Tumor cells stain negatively with Napsin, TTF-1, and p63.  Although this does not exclude a lung primary, it makes it less likely.

Received fresh for frozen section designated \""left lower lobe\"" is a 275 gram lobectomy\X0D\\X0A\specimen measuring 22.5 x 12.5 x up to 4.0 cm.  The pleural surface is red-tan and\X0D\\X0A\glistening with two distinct areas of puckering noted 4.0 cm from the stapled bronchial\X0D\\X0A\margin.  The bronchial margin is shaved and submitted on a single block for frozen section.\X0D\\X0A\Following frozen section, the specimen is submitted in cassette A-FSC.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Blue and black ink are placed on the areas of puckering on the pleural surface.

This is squamous carcinoma, moderately differentiated in a background of a mixed inflammatory cell population and mucus.  This is consistent with the tumor diathesis of invasion.  The tumor is moderately differentiated.  Molecular pathology, specifically the lung algorithm including EGFR mutation is in process and a supplemental report will follow.  NOTE: There may not be enough tissue left in the block to complete this important analysis.  Bronch wash #2 and #3, right upper lobe, are both positive for squamous carcinoma.

No break-apart signal pattern, specific for ALK (2p23) rearrangements that occur in t(2;5) and variants, was detected.  However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities.  Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.  FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) dual color break-apart probe (**INSTITUTION., Des Plaines, IL).\X0D\\X0A\MOLEC COMMENTS: Table:  Exon 19 deletion, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Deletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  L858R, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L858R confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  G719S, G719A, G719C, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Mutations at codon 719 in exon 19 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy, (slightly more than 50%) \X0D\\X0A\although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21.  S7681, Lack of responsiveness to TKI Mutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy.  L861Q, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L861Q confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs.  T790M, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, T790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs. It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone.  Exon 20 insertion, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, Insertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations. This is a rare mutation however, and robust clinical data is lacking.  References: (1) **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. et al. N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004. (2) Wu, Jenn-Yu et al.

N Engl J Med **ID-NUM, 2005.   Methodology: Tumor areas of interest were identified and selectively microdissected from the paraffin-embedded tissue section. The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample. The DNA yield was determined, and the samples were brought to an optimal concentration. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene. Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.  Intended Use: The EGFR mutation analysis by real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management. The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient. There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI's. This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1-5% in a background of wild-type alleles. These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva).  * An \""Alteration Not Detected\"" result does not preclude the presence of an EGFR mutation since results depend on percent mutant sequences, adequate specimen integrity, absence of inhibitors, and sufficient DNA to be detected.

The tumor cells are negative for other markers including CD-15, CK-5/6, B72.3, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD-56, thyroglobulin, GCDFP-15, p63, mammoglobin and progesterone receptor. Estrogen receptor shows focal positivity in about 30% of nuclei. Mucicarmine is negative for the detection of intracellular mucin. This immunophenotype with a strong positivity for TTF-1 is most consistent with a diagnosis of a poorly differentiated carcinoma, non-small cell type from a lung primary.

The anterior and posterior endomyometrium is\X0D\\X0A\involved by a 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.8 cm tan friable mass with probable involvement of\X0D\\X0A\the posterior lower uterine segment. Sectioning reveals invasion into the\X0D\\X0A\myometrium. The invasion is grossly confined to the upper one-half of the\X0D\\X0A\myometrial thickness. The remaining myometrium is tan and trabecular with a\X0D\\X0A\single well-circumscribed tan intramural nodule measuring 1.5 cm in greatest\X0D\\X0A\dimension. The bilateral ovaries average 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm and sectioning of\X0D\\X0A\each reveals a tan predominantly solid cut surface. No suspicious cysts or\X0D\\X0A\nodules are identified.

The tumor obliterates a portion\X0D\\X0A\of the calyces and displaces the pelvis.  Tumor invades renal pelvic sinus\X0D\\X0A\adipose tissue. The lesion appears to be confined by the capsule and comes to\X0D\\X0A\within 0.1 cm of the peripheral soft tissue margin.  This margin is inked black\X0D\\X0A\for lateral identification.

This\X0D\\X0A\pattern argues against transitional carcinoma. A second panel of\X0D\\X0A\immunohistochemical stains including cytokeratin, inhibin, calretinin, ER,\X0D\\X0A\and P53 are performed to confirm a diagnosis of carcinoma and to exclude a\X0D\\X0A\sex cord-stromal tumor. The tumor is negative for inhibin and calretinin and\X0D\\X0A\is strongly positive for ER, cytokeratin and P53. While the tumor does not\X0D\\X0A\have the morphology of a typical serous tumor, some of the foci show nuclear\X0D\\X0A\clearing, particularly in the diaphragmatic and liver capsule metastases.\X0D\\X0A\However, P53 positivity is rare in clear cell and endometriod ovarian tumors.\X0D\\X0A\The findings are most consistent with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Since a\X0D\\X0A\large portion of the tumor is seen within the right ovary, it will be staged\X0D\\X0A\as an ovarian primary although the ipsilateral fallopian tube also shows\X0D\\X0A\considerable tumor.

The specimen weighs 66 grams.  The capsule, although intact, shows evidence of probable fibrovascular adhesions.  The outer surface is inked with black.  The specimen is serially sectioned.  A portion of the mass is solid tan-red and representative sections of this including the nearest surgical margins are placed in Blocks 1-8.  A significant portion of the mass is more friable, hemorrhagic, showing evidence of probable cystic degeneration. This area is represented in Blocks 9-12.  A representative section of the more solid appearing area is also placed in Block FS.","COMMENT WORD: The right thyroid is found to be replaced by large 7 x 5.5 x 3 cm. mass.  The mass is predominantly solid with focal evidence of degeneration and hemorrhage.  Microscopically the mass consists of variably sized follicular structures usually containing colloid.  There is mild nuclear pleomorphism with cells having enlarged nuclei with open chromatin patterns. Cytoplasm is moderately abundant and eosinophilic.  The mitotic rate is low.  Although no definite desmoplastic reaction is identified in the capsule, within multiple sites extension into vascular structures is found.  These protrusions or plugs into the blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells.  This finding of vascular extension is felt to indicate the presence of follicular carcinoma.  The follicular mass appears to be confined to the thyroid gland.  Staging criteria: T3 possible Stage II.  Histopathologic grade: G2, moderately differentiated.  Histopathologic type: follicular carcinoma.

The renal vein is probe patent\X0D\\X0A\with no obstructing masses identified. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a 3.8 x\X0D\\X0A\3.0 x 2.8 cm well-circumscribed golden yellow focally hemorrhagic mass with\X0D\\X0A\questionable focal extension outside the renal capsule.

Specimen #1 is labeled ""right pelvic lymph nodes"". It consists of a 3.5 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm portion of adipose tissue. Dissection reveals two small portions of apparent lymph node, and both of these are frozen. The remaining frozen tissue is submitted as frozen section control in cassette 1FSA (2). After formalin fixation, the fibroadipose tissue is further dissected, and an additional 0.5 cm pink-tan apparent lymph node is identified. This lymph node is entirely submitted for permanent section in cassette 1A. Total two cassettes.  2. Specimen #2 is labeled ""left pelvic lymph nodes"". It consists of a 3.0 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm portion of adipose tissue. Dissection reveals several rather small fragments of apparent lymph node. The lymph node fragments are entirely frozen. The remainder of the frozen tissue is submitted as frozen section control in cassette 2FSA (5).  3. Specimen #3 is received in formalin labeled ""prostate"". It consists of a radical prostatectomy with bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferentia attached. A large tan suture is attached to the superior midline of the specimen. The specimen weighs 29 gm. The right superior apex shows an underlying tan-white nodule that measures 0.9 cm. The prostate gland measures 4.6 cm medial to lateral, 3.4 cm anterior to posterior, and 2.1 cm proximal to distal. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.6 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. The right vas deferens measures 2.0 x 0.5 cm. The left vas deferens measures 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Margins are inked black. Sectioning of right vas deferens and seminal vesicle reveal pink-tan glandular tissue with some tan mucoid material, and this is sampled in cassette 3A. Sectioning of left seminal vesicle and vas deferens reveals pink-tan glandular tissue with some mucoid tissue, and this is sampled in cassette 3B. After removal of seminal vesicles and vas deferentia, the prostate gland weighs 19 gm. The apex is shaved from the specimen, and the right apex includes a 1.0 cm tan-pink to yellow nodular area. 3C-right apex, 3D-left apex. The bladder base portion is granular, and it is shaved from the specimen and sampled en fas in cassettes 3E, F. Sectioning of the remaining prostate gland includes a 1.5 x 1.0 cm yellow nodular area of the right posterior prostate gland, abutting the inked area. 3G-right anterior, 3H-left anterior \X0D\\X0A\3I-K-right posterior, proceeding from apex to base \X0D\\X0A\3L-N-left posterior, proceeding from apex to base. The posterior base shows additional focal yellow-tan coloration, more so on the right, and a section is cut in half to include left and right and submitted in cassette 3O. Approximately 90% of the gland was submitted. Total fifteen cassettes.","MICRO: 1, 2. Microscopic examination performed.  3. Bilateral posterior lobes of prostate gland are extensively involved with adenocarcinoma, the largest focus on the slide approximating 2.0 cm. The apical margin (3C) is involved over 4 mm area. The left apical margin (3D) is involved over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm area. The bladder base margin was shaved from the specimen and is involved over a 1.0 x 0.4 cm area. One slide (3I) shows right posterior margin involvement over a 3-4 mm area. One slide (3L) shows left posterior margin involvement over a 1.1 cm area. The tumor invades into the prostate capsule in many areas, often associated with perineural invasion. Slide 3O includes a single focus of tumor with perineural invasion present in periprostatic adipose tissue.","ICD9 CODES: 185, , \X0D\\X0A\LAB_COMM: rc's to see ink fill in around edges of these pieces to see all margin.

The specimen has an overall total weight of 307 grams.  There\X0D\\X0A\is a moderate amount of attached fat.  The posterior surface of the\X0D\\X0A\bladder is surfaced by a gray-purple smooth serosa.  The bladder is 5.5\X0D\\X0A\x 5.5 x 2.5 cm.  The prostate gland is 4.8 x 4 x 3.3 cm.  The attached\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicles are each approximately 3 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm.  The left vas\X0D\\X0A\deferens is 7 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, while the right\X0D\\X0A\vas deferens is 2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter.  The prostate is\X0D\\X0A\inked in the following manner:  right side blue; left side black;\X0D\\X0A\posterior over-inked red.  The posterior surface of the bladder is also\X0D\\X0A\inked red while the anterior surface is inked blue.  There are attached\X0D\\X0A\segments of right and left ureter which are each 2.5 cm in length x 0.4\X0D\\X0A\cm in diameter.  Opening the bladder reveals an ill-defined focally\X0D\\X0A\hemorrhagic scarred appearing area on the posterior wall which has\X0D\\X0A\overall dimensions of 3 x 2 cm.  The mucosa within this area is slightly\X0D\\X0A\indurated.  There are no distinct papillary lesions grossly identified.\X0D\\X0A\The scarred hemorrhagic area is 0.7 cm from the right ureteral orifice\X0D\\X0A\and 1 cm from the left ureteral orifice.  The lesional area is also 1 cm\X0D\\X0A\from the bladder base / prostatic urethral orifice and 4.5 cm from the\X0D\\X0A\urethral margin.

The lining epithelium is benign and\X0D\\X0A\shows only mild reactive changes without evidence of any marked\X0D\\X0A\cytologic atypia or invasive process present.\X0D\\X0A\B)  This specimen shows a full thickness cross section of the ureter\X0D\\X0A\with a normal architecture.  The lining urothelium shows the focal\X0D\\X0A\presence of markedly atypical transitional cells.  These focally involve\X0D\\X0A\the entire thickness of the mucosa.  There is no evidence of any\X0D\\X0A\invasive process present.\X0D\\X0A\C)  This specimen shows a full thickness cross section of ureter.  The\X0D\\X0A\architecture is normal.  The lining epithelium shows only mild reactive\X0D\\X0A\changes and the full thickness markedly-atypical epithelium seen in the\X0D\\X0A\prior specimen is not present in this tissue particularly at the end of\X0D\\X0A\the sutured resection margin.\X0D\\X0A\D)  The posterior bladder wall shows some fibrous scarring and also\X0D\\X0A\nearby residual papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade, with\X0D\\X0A\superficial invasion into the lamina propria.  No definite residual\X0D\\X0A\myoinvasion can be identified.  The muscularis propria and serosal\X0D\\X0A\surface adjacent to the tumor are unremarkable.  Sections from the dome\X0D\\X0A\of the bladder are benign and reveal benign epithelial inclusions within\X0D\\X0A\the wall, possibly representing a urachal remnant.  The anterior wall\X0D\\X0A\shows evidence of chronic cystitis and mild urothelial atypia.  The left\X0D\\X0A\and right lateral bladder walls also show evidence of chronic cervicitis\X0D\\X0A\with some urothelial atypia but no definite carcinoma.  The right\X0D\\X0A\ureteral orifice shows evidence of some urothelial atypia without\X0D\\X0A\definite neoplasm.  Sections from the left ureteral orifice do reveal\X0D\\X0A\the presence of high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma involving the\X0D\\X0A\distal ureter and its junction with the bladder.  Multiple sections from\X0D\\X0A\both sides of the totally embedded prostate gland reveal glandular and\X0D\\X0A\stromal hyperplasia with focal areas of chronic prostatitis as well as\X0D\\X0A\bilateral multifocal high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.\X0D\\X0A\Both halves of the prostate gland in addition show microscopic foci of\X0D\\X0A\an infiltrating adenocarcinoma present.  It consists of two patterns.\X0D\\X0A\One consists of well-formed glandular structures infiltrating between\X0D\\X0A\pre-existing benign glandular structures (Gleason grade 3).  Other areas\X0D\\X0A\show some tendency to gland fusion as well as very large complex\X0D\\X0A\cribriform structures (Gleason grade 4).  No definite perineural or\X0D\\X0A\lymphvascular invasion can be identified.  The neoplasm is bulging up\X0D\\X0A\underneath the prostate capsule without significant invasion into or\X0D\\X0A\through the capsule.  Sections from the coned urethral/apical margin are\X0D\\X0A\benign.  The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are unremarkable\X0D\\X0A\bilaterally.  Sections from the right ureteral orifice show some eroded\X0D\\X0A\mildly atypical urothelium without evidence of definite carcinoma.\X0D\\X0A\Sections from the left urethral orifice reveal extensively eroded,\X0D\\X0A\somewhat atypical urothelium without definite carcinoma identified.  The\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are unremarkable bilaterally.  The\X0D\\X0A\right and left paravesicular soft tissue margins are benign.  There is a\X0D\\X0A\benign paravesicular lymph node and several benign paravesicular\X0D\\X0A\fibrocalcific nodules which probably represent old fat necrosis or\X0D\\X0A\possibly extruded phleboliths.\X0D\\X0A\E)  This specimen shows a large lymph node.  It shows an intact capsule\X0D\\X0A\and a normal architecture except for prominent fatty replacement of the\X0D\\X0A\lymph node hilum.  There is no evidence of any primary or metastatic\X0D\\X0A\neoplasm present.\X0D\\X0A\F)  This lymph node also shows an intact capsule and a fairly normal\X0D\\X0A\lymph node except for fatty replacement of the lymph node hilum.  There\X0D\\X0A\is no evidence of any primary or metastatic neoplasm present.\X0D\\X0A\G)  This specimen shows small intestinal tissue with evidence of acute\X0D\\X0A\congestion and some serosal adhesions but no other pathologic\X0D\\X0A\abnormalities.  There is no evidence of any significant inflammation or\X0D\\X0A\any involvement by neoplasm.

The specimen consists of an\X0D\\X0A\unoriented pink-tan segment of ureter, which is 0.4 cm in length x 0.3\X0D\\X0A\cm in diameter.  Touch preps are obtained, and the specimen is submitted\X0D\\X0A\entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now\X0D\\X0A\resubmitted in toto for permanents in cassette AFSc.\X0D\\X0A\Part B is received fresh in a Petri dish for frozen section,\X0D\\X0A\additionally labeled ""left ureter"".  The specimen consists of an\X0D\\X0A\unoriented pink-tan segment of ureter which is 0.4 cm in length x 0.3 cm\X0D\\X0A\in diameter.  Touch preps are obtained, and the specimen is submitted\X0D\\X0A\entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now\X0D\\X0A\resubmitted in toto for permanents in cassette BFSc.\X0D\\X0A\Part C is received in formalin, additionally labeled ""bladder"".  The\X0D\\X0A\specimen consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen which has an overall\X0D\\X0A\weight of 222 grams.  The prostate is markedly disrupted and has been\X0D\\X0A\previously separated into two pieces, with the distal half of the\X0D\\X0A\prostate being amputated from the remainder of the specimen.  The smooth\X0D\\X0A\aspect of the amputated prostate fragment is presumed posterior.  This\X0D\\X0A\fragment of prostate is 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm.  The remainder of the\X0D\\X0A\specimen is comprised of the bladder with apparent residual prostate\X0D\\X0A\tissue.  The remainder of the prostate measures approximately 4.0 x 3.0\X0D\\X0A\x 1.5 cm.  The attached bladder is approximately 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm.\X0D\\X0A\The posterior peritoneal reflection is pink-tan and smooth.  The\X0D\\X0A\anterior surface of the bladder is markedly indurated.  The posterior\X0D\\X0A\half of the segment is inked red, while the anterior surface is inked\X0D\\X0A\blue.  Opening the bladder reveals an ulcerated indurated mass involving\X0D\\X0A\the left upper wall of the bladder.  The ulcerative lesion extends to\X0D\\X0A\and involves both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the bladder.\X0D\\X0A\The lesion is 3.5 x 2.5 cm.  The lesion has an ulcerative base with dark\X0D\\X0A\red yellowish necrotic raised edges.  The lesion is 3.0 cm from the\X0D\\X0A\bladder base / proximal prostatic urethra and 2.5 cm superior to the\X0D\\X0A\left ureteral orifice.  Sectioning through the lesion reveals possible\X0D\\X0A\full-thickness involvement of the bladder wall; however, the lesion does\X0D\\X0A\not grossly extend into the perivesicular fat.  There are no other\X0D\\X0A\distinct mass lesions identified.  The posterior bladder mucosa is\X0D\\X0A\diffusely erythematous.  The ureter segments are each approximately 2 cm\X0D\\X0A\in length x 0.3 cm in diameter.  The ureters are lined by pink-tan\X0D\\X0A\smooth urothelium with no papillary excrescences.\X0D\\X0A\Sectioning through the base of the bladder reveals minimal possible\X0D\\X0A\residual prostate tissue at the bladder base.  The previously amputated\X0D\\X0A\prostate fragment is markedly disrupted along the anterior surface, and\X0D\\X0A\the prostatic urethral margin and cannot be accurately grossly\X0D\\X0A\identified due to the fragmented nature of the specimen.  The posterior\X0D\\X0A\surface of the prostate is inked red.  Sectioning the prostate fragment\X0D\\X0A\reveals abundant yellowish discoloration.  Within the left and right\X0D\\X0A\posterior quadrants of the prostate, there are no distinct\X0D\\X0A\well-circumscribed prostatic nodules or masses.  A thorough search of\X0D\\X0A\the perivesicular fat reveals ten potential lymph nodes.  Received\X0D\\X0A\separately in the specimen container is a fragment of seminal vesicle,\X0D\\X0A\which is 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  Sectioning the seminal vesicle fragment\X0D\\X0A\reveals a grossly unremarkable cut surface.  Representative sections are\X0D\\X0A\submitted as follows:\X0D\\X0A\C1     perpendicular section of inked right perivesicular soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\C2     perpendicular section of inked left perivesicular soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\C3     trigone to prostatic urethra\X0D\\X0A\C4     longitudinal section of right ureteral orifice\X0D\\X0A\C5     longitudinal section of left ureteral orifice\X0D\\X0A\C6     right bladder wall\X0D\\X0A\C7     dome of bladder\X0D\\X0A\C8     posterior bladder wall\X0D\\X0A\C9 and C10     posterior bladder wall with lesion\X0D\\X0A\C11 through C14     left bladder wall with lesion\X0D\\X0A\C15 and C16     anterior bladder wall with lesion (lesion entirely\X0D\\X0A\submitted)\X0D\\X0A\C17     possible shaved prostatic urethral margin\X0D\\X0A\C18 through C21     representative sections of right prostate\X0D\\X0A\C22 through C24     representative sections of left prostate\X0D\\X0A\C25     representative sections of seminal vesicle fragment\X0D\\X0A\C26     four whole lymph nodes\X0D\\X0A\C27     five whole lymph nodes\X0D\\X0A\C28     one lymph node bisected.\X0D\\X0A\JAB:dar\X0D\\X0A\Additional sections of the prostate are subsequently submitted in\X0D\\X0A\cassettes C29 through C32.\X0D\\X0A\JAB:DRJ","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\A)   Review of the touch preparation, frozen, and permanent section\X0D\\X0A\control slides shows a cross section of benign ureter with no dysplasia\X0D\\X0A\or infiltrating carcinoma identified.\X0D\\X0A\B)   Review of the touch preparation, frozen, and permanent section\X0D\\X0A\control slides shows a cross section of benign ureter with no dysplasia\X0D\\X0A\or infiltrating carcinoma identified.

"2998","PROSTATE",,,,,"PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: PROSTATE CANCER.","GROSS DESCRIPTION: Four specimens are received in formalin. Specimen #1 - is labeled right obturator node and consists of two fatty yellow fragments of tissue measuring in aggregate 2.6 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm.  Each is palpated for lymph nodes.  Two lymph nodes are identified.  The first measures 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  The lymph node is serially sectioned in a breadloaf fashion to reveal a fatty parenchyma.  The lymph node is entirely submitted in ""1A"".  The second lymph node measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm.  It is bisected and is submitted entirely in ""1B"". Specimen #2 - is labeled left obturator node and consists of a yellow fatty portion of tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm.  The fatty tissue is palpated for lymph nodes.  A single lymph node is identified measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.  It is bisected and is submitted entirely in cassette ""2"". Specimen #3 - is labeled prostate.  The prostate specimen reveals a distorted and deformed prostate, difficult to discern anatomic landmarks.  The surgeon is phoned and the case is discussed.  The prostate weighs 110.6 grams and appears to have two separate lobes, which are detached and pulled apart and show two traversing fibrous strands crossing the antrerior two lobes.  A small vas deferens and seminal vesicle are present and the remaining vas deferens and seminal vesicle are embedded in the tissue.  This protruding vas deferens measures 1.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. and the seminal vesicle measures 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.  The second stub of vas deferens appears hemorrhagic and measures 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The seminal vesicle measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm.  The prostate is re-approximated and measures 6.8 (superior-inferior) x 6.3 (medial-lateral) x 5.3 (anterior-posterior) cm.  The specimen is inked, with the smooth flat probable previously conjoined lobes and posterior lobe, black.  The presumed anterior left lobe is inked green and the presumed anterior right lobe is inked blue.  The divided lobes make identification of distal urethral margin difficult. A probed patent focus is not identified.  Shaved sections of the proximal urethral margin is submitted maintaining right and left.  The prostate is then serially sectioned beginning inferiorly and progressing superiorly.  It is of note that specimen #4 is representative of apex sections.  The left and right lobes are replaced by lobules of pale yellow-tan tissue with cystic changes present along the posterior base. The specimen is submitted as follows: Vas deferens and seminal vesicles, right and left, - ""3A"" and ""3B"", shaved apical margins - ""3A"" and ""3B"" as well, shaved proximal urethral margin - ""3C"" and ""3D"". The lobes are sectioned in a breadloaf fashion and then bisected and is submitted in near entirety as follows: Sections of the left lobe are submitted inferiorly to superiorly and bisected in ""3E"" through ""3P"", ""3EE - 3HH"" Right lobe is serially sectioned inferiorly to superiorly and bisected in ""3Q"" through ""3DD"", ""3II - 3JJ"". Specimen #4 - is labeled prostate tissue apex and consists of two maroon-gray-tan fragments of apex tissue, the first measuring 2.9 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm. and the second measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm.  The largest apex fragment is serially sectioned perpendicularly to the longest axis and is entirely submitted in ""4A"" through ""4C"".
