Mucin production is present, but is not a prominent\X0D\\X0A\feature.  The ovarian serous carcinoma is also growing in a glandular\X0D\\X0A\pattern, but it lacks the slit-like spaces of the endometrial tumor, and\X0D\\X0A\shows much more mucin production.  In addition, no involvement of the ovarian\X0D\\X0A\surface, bilateral parametria, or uterine serosa was observed.  These\X0D\\X0A\features would favor two synchronous primaries.  However, the ovarian tumor\X0D\\X0A\has a cystic background and consists entirely of intraepithelial carcinoma,\X0D\\X0A\with no lower-grade \""borderline\"" areas observed.  This is distinctly unusual,\X0D\\X0A\and a metastasis cannot be excluded.  If the ovarian tumor represents a\X0D\\X0A\metastasis from the endometrium, the endometrial stage would be pT3a. \X0D\\X0A\Clinical correlation is suggested.\X0D\\X0A\     P53 immunohistochemical stains were performed on both the ovarian and\X0D\\X0A\endometrial tumors and were both positive, confirming serous subtype.  Given\X0D\\X0A\the mucin production of the ovarian tumor, a CK20 immunohistochemical stain\X0D\\X0A\was also performed to exclude a colonic metastasis, and was negative.  This\X0D\\X0A\case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.\X0D\\X0A\ENDOMETRIAL TUMOR (template #2)\X0D\\X0A\Last updated **DATE[Sep 2010] (AJCC 7th Edition \T\ 2009 CAP checklist)\X0D\\X0A\Type of surgery:  total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and\X0D\\X0A\regional lymph node sampling\X0D\\X0A\Weight of uterus:  195 grams post fixation\X0D\\X0A\Dimensions of uterus:  10.5 cm (length) x 5.8 cm (width) x 5 cm\X0D\\X0A\(anterior-posterior dimension)\X0D\\X0A\Histologic type of the tumor:  serous carcinoma\X0D\\X0A\Tumor grade of differentiation (FIGO grade I/II/III):  III\X0D\\X0A\Tumor size:   8.5 cm (greatest dimension) x 3 cm (smaller dimension) x 1.8 cm\X0D\\X0A\(maximum thickness) \X0D\\X0A\Distance from internal os:  1.5 cm\X0D\\X0A\Confined to endometrium:  no\X0D\\X0A\Myometrial invasion:  yes (outer 1/2) \X0D\\X0A\Depth of invasion:   60% of myometrial involvement \X0D\\X0A\                                (9 mm from EM junction / 17 mm myometrial\X0D\\X0A\thickness) *   \X0D\\X0A\Nontumorous endometrium:  not identified\X0D\\X0A\Serosal involvement:  no\X0D\\X0A\Adnexal involvement (right and left):  Right ovary with serous carcinoma (see\X0D\\X0A\comment above).\X0D\\X0A\Parametrial soft tissues:   no\X0D\\X0A\Cervical involvement:\X0D\\X0A\     Endocervical epithelium:  no\X0D\\X0A\     Stroma:  no\X0D\\X0A\Lymphvascular invasion:  no definite\X0D\\X0A\Lymph node involvement (specify):   0 positive / 16 total\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Other sites of involvement (list):  pelvic washing positive for\X0D\\X0A\adenocarcinoma (***PATH-NUMBER[2])\X0D\\X0A\Pathologic stage (pTNM)\X0D\\X0A\Primary Tumor (pT)\X0D\\X0A\pT              FIGO\X0D\\X0A\pT1b    IB            Tumor invades = 1/2 of the myometrium\X0D\\X0A\Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)\X0D\\X0A\pN0                                No regional lymph node metastasis\X0D\\X0A\Distant Metastasis (pM)\X0D\\X0A\                                       Not applicable\X0D\\X0A\OVARIAN TUMOR (template #29)\X0D\\X0A\Last updated **DATE[Sep 2010] (AJCC 7th Edition \T\ 2009 CAP checklist)     \X0D\\X0A\Growth involving:   right ovary \X0D\\X0A\Histologic type: serous\X0D\\X0A\Tumor grade of differentiation: \X0D\\X0A\         2-tier system (Malpica et al) for serous carcinoma only (low-grade\X0D\\X0A\vs high-grade): high grade\X0D\\X0A\Main tumor dimensions: 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm\X0D\\X0A\Lymphvascular invasion: no\X0D\\X0A\Capsular involvement:    no\X0D\\X0A\Pelvic extension:\X0D\\X0A\     Fallopian tubes: no\X0D\\X0A\     Parametria: no\X0D\\X0A\     Uterus:  also involved by a serous carcinoma (please see comment above\X0D\\X0A\for details)\X0D\\X0A\     Cervix: no\X0D\\X0A\Peritoneal implants:    unknown\X0D\\X0A\Lymph node involvement (specify):  0 positive / 16 total\X0D\\X0A\Metastasis (specify if present): no\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Residual ovary present:    yes \X0D\\X0A\Findings in residual ovary: no significant findings\X0D\\X0A\Contralateral ovary findings: no significant findings\X0D\\X0A\Pathologic staging (pTNM)\X0D\\X0A\PRIMARY TUMOR (pT)\X0D\\X0A\pT         FIGO\X0D\\X0A\         pT1c      IC      Tumor limited to one or both ovaries with any of\X0D\\X0A\the following: capsule ruptured, tumor on  \X0D\\X0A\                            ovarian surface, malignant cells in ascites or\X0D\\X0A\peritoneal washings\X0D\\X0A\REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (pN)\X0D\\X0A\pNO                No regional lymph node metastasis\X0D\\X0A\DISTANT METASTASIS (pM)\X0D\\X0A\                       Not applicable\X0D\\X0A\This service has been rendered in part by a resident.

The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a previously opened colon segment, measuring 29.5 x 4 cm.  Within the middle of the specimen is a circumferential mass, centrally ulcerated with peripheral heaped-up margins.  The mass measures 5.5 x 4 cm.  The serosa is tan-pink and within the area of the mass there is indentation.  Grossly the mass is variegated tan-white, moderately firm and is grossly suspicious for extending into the subserosa.  Representative sections of the mass are placed in Blocks 1-6.  The mass is well removed from the proximal and distal colonic margins which are grossly viable and represented in Block 7.  The remaining colonic mucosa is uniform tan-pink with normal rugal pattern.  No additional masses or areas suspicious for malignancy are identified.  The pericolonic adipose tissues are removed, serially sectioned and placed in lymph node revealing solution.  Also received in the container are two portions of mucosa, measuring 4 x 0.5 cm. and 2 x 1.2 cm.  These are uniform tan-pink and representative sections are placed in Block 8.  The pericolonic adipose tissues are examined and possible lymph nodes removed and placed in Blocks 9 and 10.","COMMENT WORD: The left colon is found to contain a mass, measuring 5.5 x 4 cm.  Microscopically this mass is composed of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The neoplasm extends through the muscularis propria into the subserosa.  There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the 16 examined lymph nodes.  The surgical margins are free of tumor.  Staging criteria: T3, N0 probable Stage IIA.

The tissue contains a hypercellular neoplasm with occasional pleomorphic and more abundant small cells with glial morphology, some vague nesting, and very high capillary density.  Most of the neoplastic cells have elongated to oval nuclei while a few have more rounded nuclear contours.  Admixed with the tumor cells are scattered microcalcifications.  Mitotic figures are easily identified, and foci of vascular cell proliferation (best in A2) are noted. Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate positive and negative controls are performed with the following antibodies:  GFAP, p53, Ki-67, keratin, vimentin, EMA, Neu-N, synaptophysin, S-100 protein, CD34, CD3, and CD20.  They show many neoplastic cells to be GFAP positive.  p53 shows scattered nuclear staining which is focally prominent in some areas.  The Ki-67 labeling rate is approximately 20-30% in some areas.  The CD34 preparation highlights the dense capillaries within the tumor, however there are no definite ramifying cell processes or significant staining of neoplastic cells.  EMA is negative in neoplastic cells, and there is no dot-like staining.  The keratin preparation has focal non-specific staining.  Vimentin is strongly positive.  Neu-N shows focal scattered positive neuronal nuclei which appear to represent entrapped cortical neurons within the tumor; tumor cells are negative.  The S-100 protein is focally positive.  Synaptophysin appears to have patchy, weak nonspecific staining in some areas.  CD3 has a few scattered reactive T-lymphocytes with only a rare reactive (CD20 positive) B-lymphocyte.  \X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\[IMAGE:attachments:ahs1:]","\X0D\\X0A\          \X0D\\X0A\ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY REPORT\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\     \X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\PATIENT:               **NAME[BBB, AAA]\X0D\\X0A\RECEIVED:               **DATE[Aug 05 2012]     \X0D\\X0A\REPORTED:               **DATE[Aug 10 2012]     \X0D\\X0A\SPECIMEN NO:             ***PATH-NUMBER[1]\X0D\\X0A\DOB/AGE:                 **AGE[birth-12]/**DATE[Oct 1948] (Age: **AGE[in 60s])\X0D\\X0A\LOCATION:                N.5J\X0D\\X0A\HOSP NO:                 **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\PHYSICIAN:                **NAME[ZZZ YYY], M.D.\X0D\\X0A\REFERRAL:             \X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\PATHOLOGIST: **NAME[XXX M.

There is adjacent necrosis or cyst formation inferiorly.  The radiographic impression was that the lesion could represent a metastatic lesion, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, or less likely a lymphoma.  Histologically this appears to represent a high-grade glioma with small cell features (predominantly astrocytic features).  There are some round, haloed nuclei and scattered microcalcifications/calcospherites present which prompted FISH testing for 1p/19q deletions. Per the attached report (***PATH-NUMBER[2]) from Vitro Molecular Laboratories, the tumor is negative for deletion of 1p36 and 19q13, so there is no molecular evidence of oligodendroglial differentiation.

The needle core biopsy shows adenocarcinoma.  Pulmonary parenchyma is infiltrated by malignant glandular epithelial cells focally forming malignant glandular lumina.  There is stromal desmoplasia in the background in reaction to this. Focal areas of cohesive cellular infiltrate are identified, in the minority pattern.  Most of the malignant cells are organized into nests with large malignant gland formation. \""Indian file\"" patterns are not observed.  There is a background of stromal desmoplasia and probably a background of parenchymal scar in the lung tissue.  Differential immunohistochemical stains are performed.  The CK7, TTF-1 immunostains are strongly positive in malignant glandular epithelial cells and the mucicarmine stain shows focal cytoplasmic mucin substance positivity. Immunostains ER, PR and GCD-15 are all negative.  It is noted that the patient's previous breast cancer (10-TC-3691) was ER positive at 4+ and PR positive at 1+.

The specimen consists of a segment of colon with attached terminal ileum\X0D\\X0A\and appendix.  The segment of colon measures, from ileocecal valve to distal\X0D\\X0A\resection margin, 44.5 cm in length and averages 4.8 cm in diameter.  The\X0D\\X0A\segment of terminal ileum received measures, from ileocecal valve to proximal\X0D\\X0A\resection margin, 2.5 cm in length x 2.1 cm in diameter.  The external surface\X0D\\X0A\of the distal colon reveals tightly adhesed mesocolon and omentum with puckered\X0D\\X0A\serosa.  The remaining external surface is tan-pink and smooth.  The serosal\X0D\\X0A\surface of the small bowel appears unremarkable.  The segment of colon is opened\X0D\\X0A\to reveal an annular exophytic and infiltrative mass measuring 4.5 x 4.3 cm. \X0D\\X0A\The mass extends to within 3.7 cm of the stapled distal resection margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\serosa and fatty tissue surrounding the mass are inked black. Sectioning through\X0D\\X0A\the mass shows extension through the serosa and into the surrounding fatty\X0D\\X0A\tissue.  The mass appears to abut the serosal margin where no soft tissue is\X0D\\X0A\present.  \X0D\\X0A\The lumen proximal to the mass appears dilated with slightly flattened folds. \X0D\\X0A\The wall in this area appears thickened.  Five tan-pink soft polyps are noted in\X0D\\X0A\the proximal cecum.  The polyps measure up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  The\X0D\\X0A\closest polyp to the ileocecal valve measures 0.5 cm lateral to the valve. The\X0D\\X0A\polyp closest to the mass measures 16.5 cm proximal to the mass.  Sectioning\X0D\\X0A\through each polyp reveals fatty submucosal tissue with no extension through the\X0D\\X0A\mucosa. \X0D\\X0A\The appendix measures 8.0 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter.  The serosal\X0D\\X0A\surface is tan-brown, smooth and glistening.  Sectioning reveals a fecal-filled\X0D\\X0A\lumen and is otherwise unremarkable.  \X0D\\X0A\The omentum and surrounding fatty tissue are dissected and reveals multiple\X0D\\X0A\lymph node candidates measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.

The specimen\X0D\\X0A\consists of a radical prostatectomy with attached segments of seminal\X0D\\X0A\vesicles and apparent detached tubular segments of vas deferens.  The\X0D\\X0A\main prostatectomy specimen body measures 5.3 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm.  The right\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm, and the left measures 3.0 x\X0D\\X0A\1.6 x 1.4 cm.  The short stump-like segment of possible right and left\X0D\\X0A\vas deferens is noted on the base near the insertion point of the\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicles.  The outer surface is shaggy gray-tan over the body of\X0D\\X0A\the prostate.  The right side is inked black, and the left side is inked\X0D\\X0A\blue over the anterior and posterior capsular surfaces.  The right\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicle is also inked black, and the left seminal vesicle is\X0D\\X0A\also inked blue.  A small amount of irregular rubbery tissue is noted\X0D\\X0A\anterior to the seminal vesicles over both the right and left sides,\X0D\\X0A\bordering the bladder neck margin.  This tissue is included in the\X0D\\X0A\differential inking.  The seminal vesicles and vas deferens are then\X0D\\X0A\amputated at their bases, and the body of the prostate overall weighs\X0D\\X0A\49.3 grams.  The apex and bladder base margins are both removed in a\X0D\\X0A\conical fashion, and both are submitted in a radial sectioned pattern as\X0D\\X0A\follows:\X0D\\X0A\1 - right side apex\X0D\\X0A\2 - left side apex\X0D\\X0A\3 - right side bladder base\X0D\\X0A\4 - left side bladder base.\X0D\\X0A\The gland is then divided into the right and left halves, and the right\X0D\\X0A\half is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal generally\X0D\\X0A\heterogeneous pink to yellow-tan rubbery tissue with a few cystic spaces\X0D\\X0A\between 0.2 to 0.3 cm, and a gray-tan nodule measuring up to 0.6 cm near\X0D\\X0A\the mid point between the anterior and posterior lobes.  No necrosis is\X0D\\X0A\observed.  The superior soft tissues show dense rubbery white-tan\X0D\\X0A\indurated tissue and softer amounts of lobulated yellow adipose tissue.\X0D\\X0A\The left side of the prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a rubbery\X0D\\X0A\similar consistency throughout with a few white-tan nodules between 0.3\X0D\\X0A\to 1.2 cm noted.

The right bladder base margin is focally involved by\X0D\\X0A\adenocarcinoma, and the left bladder base margin appears more\X0D\\X0A\extensively involved by adenocarcinoma with a few foci representing\X0D\\X0A\Gleason pattern 4.  Sections from the right side of the prostate show\X0D\\X0A\multiple scattered foci of mixed Gleason pattern 3 and focal Gleason\X0D\\X0A\pattern 4 adenocarcinoma, the largest up to 0.8 cm in greatest nodular\X0D\\X0A\dimension.  The tumor focally involves the right peripheral soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\margin, at the anterior aspect.  No definitive perineural invasion is\X0D\\X0A\identified.

As a consequence of this alteration, these adenocarcinomas are all associated with\X0D\\X0A\high-level `microsatellite instability' (MSI), the most common mechanism of which is loss of\X0D\\X0A\function of one or more of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins known as MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, and\X0D\\X0A\PMS2. Molecular testing for MSI or immunohistochemical studies looking for loss of\X0D\\X0A\expression of the MMR proteins are thus effective methods of screening for this unique\X0D\\X0A\subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas. IHC, particularly with the use of antibodies to all\X0D\\X0A\four major MMR proteins, can identify MSI adenocarcinomas with extremely high sensitivity\X0D\\X0A\and specificity. Furthermore, IHC analysis of the four MMR proteins can provide a highly\X0D\\X0A\sensitive strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation-carrying, early-onset\X0D\\X0A\colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, many of whom might be missed by using clinical criteria\X0D\\X0A\(e.g., the **PLACE Criteria) alone. IHC analysis has several advantages over MSI testing,\X0D\\X0A\as the latter is more difficult to perform, and does not provide gene-specific information.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Identification of this important subset of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data\X0D\\X0A\suggest that sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with MSI have a significantly better\X0D\\X0A\prognosis compared with those with intact MMR. In addition, several studies have suggested\X0D\\X0A\that MSI adenocarcinomas may be resistant to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Antibody/Clone            Marker For                    Results\X0D\\X0A\MLH-1/G168-728            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed\X0D\\X0A\MSH-2/G219-1129            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 002\X0D\\X0A\MSH-6/44                                   MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 0\X0D\\X0A\PMS2/MRQ-28                MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Detection System - Polymer\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE: Genetic counseling may be appropriate to explain the implication of this test results.\X0D\\X0A\A positive result, indicating loss of one or more MMR proteins, should be confirmed by\X0D\\X0A\sequencing that particular protein. MLH1 promoter methylation should be ruled out by\X0D\\X0A\appropriate testing, in cases which show loss of only MLH1 protein.

The\X0D\\X0A\background thyroid shows nodular hyperplastic changes with a moderate\X0D\\X0A\chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis noted along with small foci of Hurthle\X0D\\X0A\cell change.  These features may suggest Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  The\X0D\\X0A\nodular adenomatous hyperplastic changes extend into the thyroid region.\X0D\\X0A\Sections of the additional right lobe tissue show similar benign nodular\X0D\\X0A\thyroid changes in the background along with chronic lymphocytic\X0D\\X0A\thyroiditis.  At least two separate fragments of benign thymic tissue\X0D\\X0A\are noted with Hassall's corpuscles, showing focal degenerative changes\X0D\\X0A\along with dystrophic calcifications.

The neoplasm extends into adipose tissues and there is chronic inflammation as well as desmoplastic reaction.  The cells contain large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei with variably clumped chromatin patterns, irregular outlines and variably sized nucleoli.  Mitoses are easily identified, oftentimes multiple per high-power field.  The biopsy is felt to demonstrate the presence of invasive poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma.  The longest continuous segment of neoplasm in the submitted biopsy tissue measures 8 mm. in length.  Staging criteria will be completed if additional tissue is received.  Histopathologic grade: tubule formation 3, nuclear pleomorphism 2 and mitotic count 3 for a total score of 8 points, a Grade III, G3 high histologic grade neoplasm.  Histopathologic type: invasive ductal carcinoma.  The breast tumor profile analysis will be performed and reported separately.","Submitting Physician: **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Status: SOUT.

"2696",,,,,,"HISTORY: Squamous cell carcinoma of right lower lobe lung","GROSS: The specimen is received in formalin in three containers.  1. Specimen #1 is labeled \""inferior pulmonary ligament node\"". A lobulated maroon-gray lymph node measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. Sectioning reveals pink-gray to focal black lymph node tissue. No discrete tumor masses are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette (3).  2. Specimen #2 is labeled \""right lower lobe\"". A lobectomy of lung weighs 450 gm and measures 10.0 cm superior to inferior, 7.0-11.0 cm medial to lateral, and 6.0-7.3 cm anterior to posterior.  The pleural surfaces are purple, with slight fibrous adhesions.  The mid-lateral pleura shows white fibrous scarring over a 6.0 x 2.0 cm area. The hilar area includes a few lymph nodes and a few staple lines.  The anterior hilum contains a 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm lymph node that is firm.  Sectioning the lymph node shows white cheesy material and some peripheral black material.  Two representative sections of this lymph node are submitted in cassettes 2A, B (1 each). Sectioning of the lung reveals a large firm infiltrate of the lung, extending from superior to inferior over a 10.0 cm area.  Sectioning reveals extension of this partially necrotic infiltrate from 2.8 cm in width superiorly to 4.5 cm in width in the mid portion and 4.0 cm in the inferior portion.  Three sections of the mass/infiltrate are submitted in cassettes 2C-E (1 each), proceeding from superior to inferior.  The specimen is allowed to fix in formalin overnight, and will be further dissected the following day.  (mfi)  The specimen is re-examined after overnight fixation in formalin. The bronchial margin area is cut somewhat diagonally and approximates 1.5 x 1.0 cm in area. Bronchial and vascular margins are shaved from the specimen and submitted in cassette 2F. Underlying bronchovascular and hilar lung tissue is shaved from the specimen and additionally sampled in cassette 2G. Some blood clot is present in peribronchial tissue approaching 1 cm from the margin, and this portion is shaved from the specimen and submitted in cassette 2H. A 0.8 cm white-black peribronchial lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2I. A peribronchial lymph node approximately 3 cm lateral to the margin measures 1 cm in diameter \X0D\\X0A\it has a white peripheral color and more central anthracotic black color. This lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2J. Some peribronchial anthracotic tissue is sampled in cassette 2K. Two elongated sections of bronchial wall are submitted in cassette 2L. No obvious gross in the bronchial tumor masses are seen. Deeper sectioning a few centimeters away from the bronchial margin reveals an additional 1.5 cm soft tan-black lymph node. It is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2M. The lateral mid pleura shows fibrous thickening over a 6 cm area, and sectioning reveals immediately underlying granular and cavitary tissue.  The pleural surface and underlying apparent tumor are extensively sampled in cassettes 2N-P (1,2,2). Further sectioning of the lung reveals nodular and cavitary changes and the gross tumor is estimated at approximately 7 cm in greatest dimension.  Firm tan-gray lung tissue extends away from this, representing additional areas of organizing pneumonia. 2Q-central tumor, 2R-superior segment consolidation \X0D\\X0A\2S-base of lung \X0D\\X0A\2T-far lateral mid lung. The base of lung includes a 3 mm calcified yellow-tan nodule. This is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2U after decalcification.  In total 21 cassettes.  (lgt)  3. Specimen #3 is labeled \""peri-esophageal lymph node\"". It consists of a large lobulated lymph node and a separate smaller fragment of lymph node. These appear to be two portions of the same lymph node.  The larger fragment measures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm.  Sectioning reveals pink-tan to focal black lymph node tissue.  A separate smaller fragment of lymph node measures 1.1 x 0.8.  This specimen is also sectioned. The smaller portion is submitted in cassette 3A (2), and the larger portion of lymph node is entirely submitted in cassettes 3B-D (2 each).","MICRO: 1. Microscopic examination is performed.  2. Most of the central lung tissue is replaced by moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Focal keratinization and extensive necrosis are present. The tumor is admixed with the fibrosis, prominent chronic inflammation, and a focal acute inflammation. Some small nodules of tumor extend along alveolar air spaces as well. Peripheral lung shows tumor focally extending through the elastic layer of pleura with VVG elastic stain on slides 2N and 2O.  The surrounding lung tissue shows extensive bronchocystic and bronchiectatic changes with fibrosis, areas of acute bronchiolitis and acute and chronic bronchopneumonia.  Focal organizing pneumonia is also present.  Only rare areas of alveolar lung tissue uninvolved with fibrosis or inflammation are seen.  Essentially the entire right lower lobe is abnormal, with central changes showing extensive carcinoma and more peripheral changes showing acute and chronic bronchopneumonia and fibrosis.  3. Microscopic examination is performed.","ICD9 CODES: 162.5, 163.1, 196.1\X0D\\X0A\COMMENTS: Staging is discussed with Dr. **NAME[M.

As a consequence of this alteration, these adenocarcinomas are all associated with\X0D\\X0A\high-level `microsatellite instability' (MSI), the most common mechanism of which is loss of\X0D\\X0A\function of one or more of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins known as MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, and\X0D\\X0A\PMS2. Molecular testing for MSI or immunohistochemical studies looking for loss of\X0D\\X0A\expression of the MMR proteins are thus effective methods of screening for this unique\X0D\\X0A\subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas. IHC, particularly with the use of antibodies to all\X0D\\X0A\four major MMR proteins, can identify MSI adenocarcinomas with extremely high sensitivity\X0D\\X0A\and specificity. Furthermore, IHC analysis of the four MMR proteins can provide a highly\X0D\\X0A\sensitive strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation-carrying, early-onset\X0D\\X0A\colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, many of whom might be missed by using clinical criteria\X0D\\X0A\(e.g., the **PLACE Criteria) alone. IHC analysis has several advantages over MSI testing,\X0D\\X0A\as the latter is more difficult to perform, and does not provide gene-specific information.\X0D\\X0A\Identification of this important subset of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data\X0D\\X0A\suggest that sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with MSI have a significantly better\X0D\\X0A\prognosis compared with those with intact MMR. In addition, several studies have suggested\X0D\\X0A\that MSI adenocarcinomas may be resistant to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Antibody/Clone            Marker For             Results\X0D\\X0A\MLH-1/G168-728        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Not Expressed\X0D\\X0A\MSH-2/G219-1129        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00224\X0D\\X0A\MSH-6/44                     MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00225\X0D\\X0A\PMS2/MRQ-28            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Not Expressed **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Detection System - Polymer\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE: Genetic counseling may be appropriate to explain the implication of this test results.\X0D\\X0A\A positive result, indicating loss of one or more MMR proteins, should be confirmed by\X0D\\X0A\sequencing that particular protein.

Two smaller pieces of tan mucosa and some maroon soft tissue measure 0.8 and 3.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm each.  The hemicolectomy specimen has a portion of terminal ileum that measures 6 cm in length.  The colon segment including cecum measures 16 cm in length.  The terminal ileum is associated with up to 3 cm of adjacent adipose tissue.  A long, thin appendix extends from the base of cecum, measures 7.2 x 0.3-0.4 cm.  Up to 1.8 cm of adipose tissue is associated with the appendix. The colon segment is associated with up to 2-2.5 cm of adjacent adipose tissue. Upon opening, the terminal ileum has a circumference of 3.5 cm and shows unremarkable tan folds. The appendix measures 4.0 x 4.0 cm and shows unremarkable tan folds. The right colon segment measures 12 cm from base of ileocecal valve to distal margin. At 1.8 cm from the base of ileocecal valve, a tan-pink, ulcerated, plaque--like oval mucosal lesion is noted, measuring 3.0 cm in length, 3.5 cm in circumference where the colon circumference is 6.6 cm, and 0.4 cm in thickness. The distal margin measures approximately 9 cm in length.  A 1.5 x 3.0 cm area of gray coloration of colonic mucosa is noted just distal to the tumor mass. No additional mucosal lesions are noted within the colon segment.  The gross pathology is reviewed with Dr.  J.  **NAME[WWW].

The underlying soft tissue is inked red, and tips as well as representative sections are submitted as cassettes A1-A2.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen B is received in formalin and labeled \""BIOPSY SITE, OMENTAL SCAR\"".  The specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm tan-white to tan-purple irregular soft  tissue fragment which is serially sectioned to reveal a somewhat firm, tan-white glistening underlying surface.  No other discrete nodules or lesions are noted.   The specimen is submitted in toto in cassettes B1-B2.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen C is received in formalin and labeled \""PERICORDAL LYMPH NODE\"".  This specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-white to tan-pink apparent lymph node along with a moderate amount of tan-yellow and fibrofatty adipose tissue.  The lymph node is bisected to reveal a tan-pink glistening surface and is submitted in its entirety as cassette C1.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen D is received in formalin and labeled \""VENA CAVA TUMOR THROMBUS\"".  The specimen consists of a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm tan-white to tan-pink irregular soft tissue fragment, which is submitted in toto as cassette D1.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen E is labeled \""RIGHT NEPHRECTOMY\"".  The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 256 gram, 11.5 x 8.0 x 4.5 cm right kidney wrapped in fascia and fat along with an attached 7.5 cm ureter. Photographs are taken. The external surface is smooth without hemorrhage, adhesions or disrupted foci. The prior biopsy site cannot be identified. Near the superior pole a tag of fatty, possible vascular tissue measuring approximately 1.5 cm extends loosely from the surface. After the outside capsule is inked black, the specimen is bivalved to reveal a 7.0 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm tan-pink to tan-purple partially necrotic and hemorrhagic mass located mainly within the superior pole of the kidney.  Tumor appears to extend beyond the original confines of the kidney but does not reach the inked surface of the fat or fascia. A portion of the mass as well as apparent normal kidney are taken for COG studies if needed.  Photographs of the bivalved kidney are obtained. The specimen is fixed overnight. Sections through the tumor show areas of thick pseudocapsule bulging beyond the contour of the kidney but in no areas does tumor appear to reach the inked surface. Sections are submitted according to the accompanying map as the following:\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\E1:          renal vascular margin and ureter margin\X0D\\X0A\E2:          (4) possible hilar lymph nodes\X0D\\X0A\E3:          (2) hilar lymph nodes\X0D\\X0A\E4-E18:          representative sections of tumor and normal kidney submitted as per the attached map\X0D\\X0A\E19:           Possible vessel/fat from superior pole\X0D\\X0A\E20-21:          Addition samples of tumor nearest inked surface\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen F is received in formalin and labeled \""PERICORDAL LYMPH NODE\"".

There are large areas of necrosis, pigmented macrophage deposition, and areas of differentiation with foci of mucinous degeneration, fibroblastic proliferation, and cyst formation.  There is also a small nodule of cartilage.  However, there is also a fair amount of residual favorable histology viable nephroblastoma.  Anaplastic features are not identified.  The tumor invades the renal sinus.  There are a few small nests which may be in small renal sinus vessels or lymphatics, but large renal sinus vessels do not appear involved.  Some of them are sclerosed.  The tumor also invades beyond the renal capsule but is confined within the tumor capsule / fascia.  A portion of adrenal gland is identified and is unremarkable.  Within the renal hilum there are five lymph nodes showing reactive hyperplasia with sinus histiocytosis and hemosiderin deposition but no metastases.  The vascular margins and ureter margin are negative for tumor. The additional fatty tag of tissue contains fat with a focus of hemorrhage and small blood vessels but does not contain a large vessel. There is no tumor in this tag of tissue.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen F:  The \""pericordal lymph node\"" specimen contains six lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia and no evidence of malignancy.  \X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen G:  The \""periaortic lymph node\"" specimen contains six lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia and no evidence of malignancy.  \X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Specimen H:  The \""distal ureter\"" shows a segment of ureter without significant histopathologic abnormality.

Summary of sections: 2A  frozen\X0D\\X0A\section residue; 2B  lateral margin; 2C  inferior margin; 2D  superior margin;\X0D\\X0A\2E  deep margin; 2F  mass taken perpendicularly to include the medial margin,\X0D\\X0A\2G-2N  representative sections of breast tissue to include probable tumor\X0D\\X0A\submitted sequentially from the medial toward the lateral aspect every 1 cm for\X0D\\X0A\a total area of 8 cm. \X0D\\X0A\HM/mbc","Microscopic Description\X0D\\X0A\Sections through specimen 1 show multiple lymph nodes with evidence of\X0D\\X0A\metastatic carcinoma. In total, eight of fourteen lymph nodes are positive for\X0D\\X0A\metastatic carcinoma. These do not show extracapsular extension. \X0D\\X0A\Sections from the right breast lumpectomy show frozen section margin to have\X0D\\X0A\infiltrating neoplasm involving both the anterior and antero-medial margins.\X0D\\X0A\Sections through margins designated lateral, inferior, and superior show no\X0D\\X0A\evidence of neoplasm. Section taken designated deep margin show neoplasm well\X0D\\X0A\away from the margin. Sections taken from the neoplasm show a ductal carcinoma\X0D\\X0A\with lobular features. The pattern and focal single file appearance of the tumor\X0D\\X0A\cells is noted; however, there are rounded nests and tubules of tumor. At areas\X0D\\X0A\of worst differentiation, the cells show large vesicular nuclei with nucleoli.\X0D\\X0A\Mitotic activity is counted between 10 and 20 per 10 HPF. Some of the cells do\X0D\\X0A\show lobular features including cytoplasmic lumina. All of the sections\X0D\\X0A\submitted show evidence of neoplasm. Focal areas of ductal carcinoma in situ are\X0D\\X0A\noted. There are foci of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with solid and\X0D\\X0A\cribriform areas as well as areas of high-grade with high-grade cytology,\X0D\\X0A\luminal necrosis, and calcification. There is cancerization of lobules in these\X0D\\X0A\areas. The in situ carcinoma comprises approximately 10% of the total tumor\X0D\\X0A\volume. There is a perineural invasion and lymphvascular invasion noted.  \X0D\\X0A\JFJ/mbc","**STREET-ADDRESS **PLACE, KY **ZIP-CODE\X0D\\X0A\**INSTITUTION - COPY\X0D\\X0A\**INSTITUTION\X0D\\X0A\ONCOLOGY PATHWAY \X0D\\X0A\Specimen(s) Received:\X0D\\X0A\1: Lymph node, regional resection\X0D\\X0A\2: Breast, Lumpectomy","Final Diagnosis\X0D\\X0A\1.
